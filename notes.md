## Assignment

1. Play some games on [MozillaLabs](https://gaming.mozillalabs.com/games/)
2. Pick out two or three you would like to take apart.  Pay special attention to the ones with a "SEE THE SOURCE" button.  Those are specifically designed for easy examination.  The others may be tricky.
3. Make some notes describing how the game works.  How would you explain it to someone who hasn't seen or played it before?  How would you describe it to someone who has never played a game before?  Programming a computer is like giving directions to a perfectly obedient idiot who hardly knows anything and takes everything you say literally.
4. Just to add to it, if there's any specific game or genre you want to talk about.  Please let me know.
